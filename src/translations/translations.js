Estás explorando parte del Arrecife Mesoamericano, rodeado de paredes dramáticas, formaciones de coral vibrantes y vida marina que aparece en casi cada inmersión. Las condiciones son ideales todo el año, el buceo a la deriva es sin esfuerzo y cada sitio ofrece algo diferente — desde bajíos tranquilos hasta paredes icónicas que caen en el azul profundo. Es el tipo de lugar donde incluso una sola inmersión se siente inolvidable.'
